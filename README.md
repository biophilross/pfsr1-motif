PfSR1 RNA Binding Motif Analysis
================================

This is a project looking to find RNA binding motifs within enriched transcript sequences based on an immunoprecipitation experiment done with PfSR1, an SR protein found in Plasmodium falciparum thats is believed to be involved in RNA alternative splicing events and other types of post transcriptional regulation.
