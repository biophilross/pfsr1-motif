PfSR1 RNA Binding Motif Analysis
================================

This is a project looking to find RNA binding motifs within enriched transcript sequences based on an immunoprecipitation experiment done with PfSR1, an SR protein found in Plasmodium falciparum that's believed to be involved in RNA alternative splicing events and other types of post transcriptional regulation.

TODO:

CHECK 1) Run FIMO on SBM-1 and SBM-2 found by Shiri et. al
CHECK 2) Analyze FIMO results and search for statistical outliers amongst normalized hits
3) Use MEME and DREME to find SBM-1 and SBM-2 again
4) Run FIMO and my own results and find statistical outliers
5) Learn to use Homer to do motif analysis...
